### Code downloading tool

### Hardware

### Troubleshooting development setup

Always double check all electronic connections.

STC-ISP says the COM port is not available: try plugging the USB into a different port on your computer. For me, only the USB on the left side closest to the back of my laptop works.

STC-ISP downloading or checking MCU makes the correct buzzing noise on the hardware, but the code does not download: Make sure that the power supply is unplugged from the board. Sometimes the conflicting power can prevent download. You can plug it back in after the code is downnloaded.
